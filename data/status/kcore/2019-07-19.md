We are deep in to Preview 8 work, wrapping up the last few things for 3.0. Stress is the name of the game, but hopefully just stressing the product and not the engineers ;). We're diving in to the reliability of Kestrel's HTTP/2 stack under heavy load thanks to some tools we're sharing with the CoreFX team. Other areas of the stack are seeing some final API tweaks to get things ready for 3.0. Of course, we're continuing to knock down the last few bugs as well.
