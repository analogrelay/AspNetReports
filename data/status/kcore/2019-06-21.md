We made significant progress on preview 7 this week. Not quite making feature complete by the end of this week, but major items are done.

Community Contributions this week:
* [Balint Farkas](https://github.com/BalintFarkas) added some tests to an earlier SignalR contribution he made.

Just _some_ of the work our team has been doing:
* We've been hard at work cleaning up after the Arcade migration, making sure disabled tests get re-enabled and build races are sorted out.
* We taught the Java SignalR Client how to call server methods with no return value and still wait for the method to complete.
* We cleaned up a bunch of pubternal APIs and refined other public APIs in SignalR.
* We taught the JavaScript SignalR Client how to fallback through transports without unneccessary renegotiation with the server.
* We updated the SignalR .NET Client's EventCounters to match the new format and patterns.
* We continued API clean-up in Kestrel and converted the existing "Connection Adaptors" to use the new Bedrock "Connection Middleware" concepts.
* We updated our platform components (runtime and targeting pack) to include the correct manifests.
* We updated Facebook Authentication components to react to recent changes to the Facebook API.
* We added features to allow gRPC to control HTTP/2 stream error codes.
* We *finally* knocked down a race in Kestrel's pipe writer... for real this time, trust us.

Work still ahead:
* Adopting the new Bedrock Client abstractions in the SignalR client.
* Restoring SignalR functional tests after the Arcade migrations.
* Providing a proper "resource" to authorization handlers when authorizing access to a specific SignalR hub method.
* Reacting to some last changes in the .NET Core host in ANCM to ensure we can load the runtime effectively.

Moving forward we're going to start looking in to some larger infrastructure issues, as we wind down our 3.0 work.
